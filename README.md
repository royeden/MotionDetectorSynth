# Motion Detector Synth
A processing sketch that uses motion detection to change the pitch of a series of synths (WIP)

## How to use
1. You will require a webcam in your device.
2. You will require to have processing 3 or newer installed.
3. You'll need these processing libraries: [Processing Video](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html), [OpenCV for processing ](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) and [Processing Sound](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html)
4. Adjust the syth values as you like (there's an array set for the lower notes & another one for the higher notes).
5. The resolution variable adjusts the resolution that you'll apply to your camera, the higher it is set, the lower resolution you'll get...
